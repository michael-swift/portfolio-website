**Currently**
I'm a quantitative biologist using ML to design better RNA therapeutics. 

I earned my PhD at Stanford in the Quake lab, where I studied the generation and maintenance of diversity in the human immune system.

**Some other interests:**

sequencing everything and everyone

sculpting biomes using gene drives

producing music
