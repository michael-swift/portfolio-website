# About Kerna Laboratories Inc.

Kerna Laboratories Inc. is a San Francisco-based AI biotechnology company dedicated to unlocking the full potential of mRNA. Founded by leading experts, the company combines advanced AI and cutting-edge science to overcome mRNA payload design and delivery bottlenecks, paving the way for a new generation of therapies.

## Our Mission

We are redefining how mRNA sequences are designed and delivered. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we're able to address bottlenecks in payload design, unlocking mRNA's immense potential to address previously untreatable conditions.

## The Challenge

Although mRNA has seen groundbreaking success in recent years, significant challenges in payload design and delivery have restricted its use beyond infectious disease. Foundation models of biology are allowing us to optimize mRNA in ways that weren't conceivable just a few years ago.

## Our Approach

Kerna Labs tackles these limitations with next-generation foundation models of RNA. Our platform combines:
- Advanced AI foundation models specifically designed for RNA
- Novel approaches to payload design optimization
- Innovative delivery system development
- Deep expertise in mRNA technology and genetic medicine

## Leadership Team

Founded nine months ago by biotech industry veterans:
- **Julia Peng** - CEO
- **Amit Deshwar** - Co-founder (ex-SVP, Deep Genomics)  
- **Melissa J. Moore** - Co-founder (ex-CSO, Moderna)
- **Michael Swift** - Founding Scientist

## Recent Milestones

Kerna Labs recently closed an oversubscribed seed funding round, with investors including Gradient, Humba Ventures, Tau Ventures, Pioneer Fund, Focalpoint Partners, and prominent angels including Patrick Hsu (Arc Institute) and Jacob Kimmel (NewLimit).

## Vision

We're on the cusp of a major leap forward in genetic medicine, and Kerna Labs is at the forefront of making that vision a reality by harnessing the power of AI applied to mRNA.
