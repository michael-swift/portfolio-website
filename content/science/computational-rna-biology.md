# Computational Approaches to RNA Biology

RNA plays critical roles in gene regulation, protein synthesis, and cellular function. Our computational biology research aims to decode these complex mechanisms and translate insights into therapeutic opportunities.

## Research Focus Areas

### RNA Structure Prediction
We develop machine learning models to predict RNA secondary and tertiary structures, enabling better understanding of RNA function and druggability.

### RNA-Protein Interactions
Our computational approaches model the complex interactions between RNA molecules and their protein binding partners, identifying intervention points for therapeutic development.

### Regulatory Network Analysis
We map and analyze regulatory networks involving non-coding RNAs to understand disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.

## Methodology

Our research combines:
- Deep learning architectures optimized for sequence data
- Physics-informed models of molecular interactions
- Large-scale data integration from multiple omics platforms
- Experimental validation in cellular and molecular systems

## Outcomes

This computational framework has led to the identification of several novel RNA targets and has informed the design of our therapeutic development pipeline.
