This study investigates how cells integrate external signals with their intrinsic state during reprogramming, using human B cells as a model system.

Key findings:
- Intrinsic cellular states significantly influence reprogramming outcomes
- Reprogrammed cell populations show high diversity in final states
- Cells from the same lineage (clones) often adopt similar fates, indicating the importance of initial cell state

These results have important implications for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. Intrinsic heterogeneity in the input cells should be understood and harnessed for better outcomes.
