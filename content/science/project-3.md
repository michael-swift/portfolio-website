I have been key contributor to the Tabula Sapiens Consortium. I helped create a multi-organ, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of humans. This atlas serves as a valuable resource for training foundation models of biology and understanding the molecular basis of diseases.

My contributions include:
- Procuring organs
- Processing tissues into single-cell suspensions
- Preparing sequencing libraries
- Analyzing vast datasets with complex and varied forms of technical noise 

Research focus:
Analyzing immune cells across tissues to gain new insights into this complex system's function and regulation within the context of the broader human atlas.
