I wanted to see if I could get anything interesting from remixing my partner's unfinished line drawings.

## AI Remixes

I asked the DALL-E API to remix it, masking various parts of the image and auto-generating prompts using GPT-3. Here are the results:

<div class="image-gallery">
  <figure>
    <img src="/images/art/first_edits/edits_1_545cd3b7.png" alt="AI-remixed line drawing: sushi chef">
    <figcaption>Sushi chef?</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/art/first_edits/edits_4_ab1adbd3.png" alt="AI-remixed line drawing with text attempt">
    <figcaption>Love it when AI tries to do text</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/art/first_edits/edits_2_12896581.png" alt="AI-remixed line drawing with color">
    <figcaption>A splash of color, please</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

To be honest, they aren't that cool. My sense is that the appeal of generative AI in art is that it brings the cost (and skill) of remixing towards zero. So I decided to make a collage of many of the remixes â€” which would maybe drive a gestalt

She didn't seem particularly moved by any of this, but was quite supportive
