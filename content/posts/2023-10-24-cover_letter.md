I'm writing a cover letter for my final paper from my PhD. I couldn't find a latex template so I made one myself. I hope it can be useful to others.

I've shared the work on my [github](https://github.com/michael-swift/JournalCoverLetter) and as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/journal-submission-cover-letter/vsvmwwszmdtn).
