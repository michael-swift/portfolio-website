I was writing a cover letter for a journal submission and got tired of manually formatting everything each time. So I made a LaTeX template to automate the process. It handles all the standard formatting and lets you just fill in the details.

The template takes care of the layout, spacing, and professional formatting automatically. You just need to update a few variables at the top of the document with your information and the journal details, and it generates a properly formatted cover letter.

I've put it up on [GitHub](https://github.com/michael-swift/JournalCoverLetter) and made it available as a template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/journal-submission-cover-letter/vsvmwwszmdtn) so anyone can use it.
