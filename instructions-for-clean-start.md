# Clean Start Instructions

Your local repo now has a fresh git history! But GitHub's branch protection is preventing the force push.

## Method 1: Remove Branch Protection (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://github.com/michael-swift/michael-swift.github.io/settings/branches
2. Delete any branch protection rules for `master`
3. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michaelswift/Documents/personal/personal_repos/michael-swift.github.io
   git push --force origin master
   ```

## Method 2: Delete & Recreate Repo (Nuclear option)

1. Go to: https://github.com/michael-swift/michael-swift.github.io/settings
2. Scroll to bottom → "Delete this repository"
3. Type the repo name to confirm
4. Create new repo with same name: `michael-swift.github.io`
5. **Don't initialize with README**
6. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michaelswift/Documents/personal/personal_repos/michael-swift.github.io
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:michael-swift/michael-swift.github.io.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```
